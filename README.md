# OBS Teleport

An [OBS Studio] plugin for an open [NDI]-like replacement. Pretty simple, straight forward. No NDI compatibility in any form.

Just as an alternative option for stream setups with multiple machines wanting to transmit some OBS Studio scenes to the main streaming machine in LAN.

## Notes

Obviously a network connection must be made between sender and receiver. So they must be on the same network for peer discovery. **In case no discovery is working, or no video/audio is being transmitted, make sure to disable network firewalls**.

Alternatively you can force the sender to listen on a specific port and set the firewall to allow this port to accept connections.

**Having at least 1 Gbps of a stable network connection is kind of required / highly recommendend.** You can try to make a lower quality stream work with less bandwidth, but this is then up to you to experiment with.

As of now only the Audio/Video filter mechanic is implemented on the filter feature. Adding it as an effect filter is currently not supported. Revert to the output mode in this case.


## Installation

Please refer to the OBS Studio documentation: [plugins-guide], on how and where to install plugins. There are too many platforms and installation options available as the scope of this project could explain and maintain.

Most platforms do have an installer though that may help you with the installation.

Binaries can be grabbed from the [Releases] section.
